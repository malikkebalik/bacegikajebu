Kids Family And Net Worth</a></p><h2>Zara Deniz Lackenby-Brown Was Kicked Out Of Villa</h2><p>The reality tv star, who previously claimed her current dating strategy was not working, created a sensation right after entering the villa.</p><p>Zara joined the cast on day three with David Salako. Right after her entrance, she caught sight of Tom Clare and was instantly enamored by him.</p><p>Now, Tom and Olivia Hawkins had something going on, and the ladies often fought over Clare’s attention.</p><p>Tom, however, had a bit of, let’s say, a playboy persona, and Zara found out that he kissed Ellie Spence. She first told Olivia and then exploded over Tom.</p><p>Fans loved Lackenby-Brown’s outspoken personality and tweeted about her reactions on Twitter. Many called her the ultimate love islander, the best contender, and so on.</p><p>Unfortunately for Zara, she couldn’t make a stable connection and was left without a partner. Ultimately, she was kicked out of the villa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zara-Deniz.jpg><p>Even after her departure, the gorgeous lady has remained in audiences’ minds, and they are eagerly hoping for her return. So, will we see her coming back to the villa?</p><p>Well, good news for Love Island viewers, the bombshell has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hinted at</a> making a Casa Amor return. If the producers asked her to return, she is all up for it.</p><p>What’s more, the reality tv star has set her sights on the new guy in the villa Jordan Odofin. As per Zara,</p><p>Jordan’s gorgeous – he’s my type to a tee and they sent him in after I left.</p><p>I was robbed, it was terrible timing but you know what you sign up for. But hopefully I get to chat to him on the outside.</p><p>Also, towards her former love interest Tom, Zara has a hostile attitude. She mentioned that she regrets nothing and the connection between her and Tom was mutual.</p><p>Adding to her comments, “He really put his eggs in my basket at one point, I was genuinely like, ‘what more can I ask for in a man.’</p><p>He was just ticking every box. <span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Until he turned into terrorist Tom, and things got a bit sticky.”</span></p><p>The fans have wanted Ms. Zara back since her surprising departure and will be genuinely pleased if she returns to the show.</p><p>The gorgeous lady created drama and provided entertainment during her time on Love Island. If she returns, she will probably cause more stir and add fun to the show.</p><p>Outside the villa, Zara is probably enjoying her time and spending quality time with her family. Whether she will come back to Love Island or not, stay tuned and watch the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK572ZqpmmWUmruqxoylmJyjlaOvunnBq6awpl2awam6yJygrbFdp66ksY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-ethnicity-race-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yang-se-jong-s-girlfriend-who-is-yang-se-jong-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yang-se-jong-s-girlfriend-who-is-yang-se-jong-dating.html>Yang Se-jongs Girlfriend: Who is Yang Se-jong Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-rapper-eve-s-clothing-line-fetish.html>What Happened to Rapper Eve's Clothing Line, Fetish?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-rapper-eve-s-clothing-line-fetish.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
