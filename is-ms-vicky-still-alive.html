However, he eventually broke his silence during his radio segment on Streetz Morning Takeover for Streetz 94.5 FM.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to Yung Joc’s explanation, he was pulled over by officers from the Atlanta Police Department while driving home to prepare for an event. A female officer identified him, leading to another officer asking him to leave the car.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Subsequently, he was handcuffed and informed that there might be a warrant for his arrest. He was then transported to the station for booking.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yung Joc paid a $1,300 bond and was released approximately two hours after the arrest.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yung Joc confirmed that the abandonment charge was related to child support payments.
