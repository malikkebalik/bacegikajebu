The show is about a group of people who hunt down a legendary treasure and emphasizes the <a href=#>theme of friendship</a>, especially between John B and the Pogues. In season 2, viewers witnessed a series of twists and turns and watched as a couple of the show’s beloved characters died, and many others barely survived.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-outer-banks-season-1-and-the-beginning-of-season-2>‘Outer Banks’: season 1 and the beginning of season 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madelyn-Cline-and-Chase-Stokes-of-Outer-Banks.jpg><p id=par-2_64>The first season of Outer Banks starts&nbsp;with John B, Kiara, Pope, and JJ living on Outer Banks Island. The group of friends discovers a sunken ship while boating after a hurricane and finds some cash and a clue to a large treasure. While they search for the gold, John B has to deal with the fact that he is getting sent to foster care.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_59>After the shooting of the sheriff, John B tries to get off the island. Viewers also watch Pope become heartbroken after confessing his feelings to Kiara. When the friends failed to find the gold on the Royal Merchant wreckage, they discovered someone else had it.&nbsp;Ward, the show’s antagonist, sent the gold to his <a href=#>beach house in the Bahamas</a>.</p><p id=par-4_61>In the season finale, his daughter Sarah and John B are on a boat to escape the latter’s conviction. However, they capsize during a storm. Meanwhile, Pope and Kiara start a relationship.&nbsp;Season 2 of Outer Banks picks up with John B and Sarah making it to the beach house. After breaking in, they see that the money is inside a safe.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everyone-who-has-died-in-outer-banks-season-2>Everyone who has died in ‘Outer Banks’ season 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>By the end of season 2, fans see that <a href=#>Ward is still alive</a>. His son, Rafe, also makes it to the end, but some others did not. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a> has a record of all the characters that died in the second season of Outer Banks.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_52>The main protagonists survive, but a few of the side characters meet their end. One of them was a pilot named Gavin. Gavin saw that Rafe was the one who killed the sheriff, and he tries to get Ward to buy his silence. Instead, Ward shoots him and disposes of the evidence.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_29>Later, Rafe and Renfield bring the Cross of Santo Domingo to Carla, Renfield’s older half-sister. Renfield and her&nbsp;get into a fight, and the struggle ends with Carla killing him.</p><p id=par-8_34>Fortunately, it would seem that Gavin and Renfield are the only ones who die in season 2 of Outer Banks. However, if the show gets a third season, more characters could get killed off.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sarah-and-ward-almost-died-as-well>Sarah and Ward almost died as well</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_51>While only a couple of characters get killed off, there are some close calls. After John B and Sarah get rescued following the boat accident, Rafe shoots Sarah. While it is an accident, she almost dies from her wound. Luckily, John B takes her to a licensed doctor for emergency treatment.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_47>Things look bleak, but Sarah begins to stabilize after the bullet gets removed. Fans were able to relax when they saw her pulse return to normal. Another twist of the season involves her father, Ward. He realized that he had a warrant out for his arrest. &nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_70>In the sixth episode, Ward lures the police to his boat. He blows the place up and makes people believe that he is dead. However, the show later reveals that he is still alive. Ward escaped the explosion by diving into the water with his scuba gear.&nbsp;Sarah is frustrated with her father due to these events, but she still feels a sense of relief knowing that he is not dead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrHSZqaurJWneqOtzaSqZquVlsCwuoxrZKyon565pr7SZpihnZGZe6nAzKVm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-all-dies-in-outer-banks-season-2-spoilers-ahead.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gil-de-ferran-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gil-de-ferran-net-worth.html>Gil de Ferran Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./anne-heche-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Anne Heche Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./anne-heche-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
