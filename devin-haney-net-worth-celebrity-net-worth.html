He went on to defeat Jorge Edgar Sillas and Roman Melendez in early 2016. In his first professional match in the United States, Haney beat Rafael Vazquez at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on the Vegas Strip. He subsequently defeated Jairo Fernandez Vargas at the Downtown Las Vegas Event Center.</p><p>After beating Clay Burns in a match in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Haney returned to Tijuana and defeated Javier Meraz via TKO.

He successfully defended his titles against Antonio Moran in May, and also won the vacant WBA International lightweight title in the process. In his next match, a victory over Zaur Abdullaev in September, Haney claimed the vacant WBC interim lightweight title. He went on to retain that title by defeating Alfredo Santiago, <a href=# title="Yuriorkis Gamboa Net Worth">Yuriorkis Gamboa</a>, <a href=# title="Jorge Linares Net Worth">Jorge Linares</a>, Joseph Diaz Jr., and George Kambosos Jr. By defeating Kambosos Jr. in mid-2022, Haney also won the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and The Ring lightweight titles, making him the undisputed lightweight champion.</p><p>Haney fought Kambosos Jr. in a rematch in October of 2022, and once again defeated him to retain his title. He mounted another successful defense of his undisputed lightweight title by defeating Vasiliy Lomachenko in the spring of 2023.

In his next match, in the spring of 2024, Haney suffered his first career loss when he was defeated by <a href=# title="Ryan Garcia Net Worth">Ryan Garcia</a> at the Barclays Center in New York. However, he was able to retain his WBC super lightweight title due to Garcia missing his weight and thus not being eligible for the title.
