Of the many roles Meghan took on throughout the years, one of her most memorable one was as a briefcase model on <a href=#>Deal or No Deal</a>. Some fans might be curious to know how much Meghan made on the show, so read on below to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Meghan-Markle-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meghan Markle worked on ‘Deal or No Deal’ in the early days of her acting career</h2><p id=par-2_38>In the 2000s, Meghan was still trying to find her footing in the entertainment industry, and she landed a role as a briefcase model on Deal or No Deal. Meghan appeared on the show for over 30 episodes.</p><p id=par-3_43>However, she did not have many good things to say about her time on Deal or No Deal. In an interview with <a href=#>Esquire</a> in 2018, Meghan <a href=#>revealed</a> she only took on the job “to make ends meet” and that it was physically exhausting.</p><p id=par-4_44>“I went from working in the U.S. Embassy in Argentina to ending up on Deal. It’s run the gamut. Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,” she said.</p><p id=par-5_34>Meghan also added, “I would end up standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much did she make on ‘Deal or No Deal’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_46>Even though Meghan did not seem like she had a blast on the show, she did stick with it for many months. This is because, compared to other jobs Meghan had at the time, the gig on Deal or No Deal came with a decent salary.</p><p id=par-7_27>According to <a href=#>Express</a>, who cited Meghan biographer Sean Smith, she “was paid $800 (£606) per episode and sometimes there were up to seven episodes filmed per day.”</p><p id=par-8_58>While trying to make it in Hollywood, Meghan also took on other jobs. Most notably, she was a skilled calligrapher and was hired to write invitation cards for different events, including Robin Thicke and Paula Patton’s wedding. It is not known how much she made from her calligraphy skills, but Meghan told Esquire that it was “super lucrative.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meghan Markle eventually became a millionaire after landing a role on ‘Suits’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_54>In the 2010s, Meghan’s luck turned around when she landed the role of Rachel Zane on <a href=#>Suits</a>. She was one of the main characters on the show, and this allowed her to have a steady income from acting. Meghan appeared on Suits for seven seasons; she left the show shortly before marrying Prince Harry.</p><p id=par-10_43>Suits also turned Meghan into a <a href=#>millionaire</a>. She reportedly earned $50,000 per episode on the show, and her rising star power also allowed her to earn money from advertising. Before joining the royal family, Meghan reportedly had a net worth of $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1pr7ErGShp6diuravx2aknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdXaeysbvRrZydpKlisqK%2BzZ6bZpmjYq5urtGinJ%2BbkaiybrnOnZylZZ%2BjeqWxwKVkqKpdo7xusMSao2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-much-meghan-markle-reportedly-earned-as-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeremy-roloff-might-be-facing-money-troubles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeremy-roloff-might-be-facing-money-troubles.html>Jeremy Roloff Might Be Facing Money Troubles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./arliss-howard-career-wife-kids-net-worth.html>Arliss Howard: Career, Wife, Kids &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./arliss-howard-career-wife-kids-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
