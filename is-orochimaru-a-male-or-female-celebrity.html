Originally male, but i’m pretty positive that he has taken over female bodies. Male, but when he started taking bodies he didn’t care whether they were male or female, pretty sure that’s why Anko had a cursed mark Anko was a test subject for the Heaven curse mark, that’s why she has it.</p><p>His original body might be long gone, but Orochimaru is still alive and well. With Orochimaru’s legion of followers and penchant for switching to new host bodies, he needs a way for his followers to know every body is still him. That’s where the Vanishing Facial Copy Jutsu comes in.</p><p>As Naruto’s longest running villain, Orochimaru is very powerful. His body has also been through some truly crazy things. In the world of Naruto, most characters are ninja. They channel the energy of their bodies into amazing feats, like running up the side of a cliff or walking on water.</p><p>Orochimaru was termed a prodigy. After Sasuke betrayed Orochimaru, deciding that the latter shouldn’t have the body of an Uchiha for his vessel, Orochimaru had to speed up his timetable. He started to try to make Sasuke’s body his host in the midst of their fight, but Sasuke was smarter than he thought.</p><h2>What does “he” mean in Orochimaru?</h2><p>He (the pronoun in which other characters uses to refer to Orochimaru) has the<strong> parasitic ability to take over other people’s bodies, including both men and women.</strong> When asked by his son about this, Orochimaru brushes away the question on whether he’s a man or a woman as an unnecessary one. 29.6K views. ·. View upvotes.</p><p>His original is probably long gone and he only alters his new bodies to look like the first one because<strong> he feels most comfortable with that </strong>. At this point, Orochimaru is just a soul that is building more and more knowledge of various jutsu while body-hopping.</p><p>Now the interesting thing is that Orochimaru takes all the<strong> persons techniques, knowledge, personality traits and kekkei genkai</strong> from his previous hosts. And we know that kekkei genkais are something that can be only inherited by specific bloodlines that are connected to Kagura Otsutski.</p><p>Every<strong> three years</strong> orochimaru has to find a new host, and it has been shown that Orochimaru is fine taking over a womans body. once the<strong> 3 years</strong> is up orochimaru has to find a new body. Now the interesting thing is that Orochimaru takes all the. Continue Reading.</p><p><strong>Orochimaru does none of that.</strong> He continues conducting his weird experiments long after the war, in a brand-new androgynous body. The main thing that has changed is that destroying and/or seizing control of Konoha no longer seems to be a focus of his.</p><p>So currently, i would say orochimaru is someone who doesnt care if he is<strong> a boy or girl</strong> because when he sent mitsuki to Konoha he only labeled himself as parent not father or mother. He is not a man nor a woman. He takes over people’s bodies. His original body was a male but now in boruto, he looks like he is a girl.</p><p>And the answer to that is we dont know the writers has not specified if<strong> Orochimaru is physically a man or a woman.</strong> And has kind of made a joke out of his current appearance. for example when Mitsuki asked him if he is his mother or his father. But yes originally Orochimaru was male both physically and mentally.</p><h2>Is Shirogane a male?</h2><p>Last month, at San Diego Comic Con, the producers of Voltron: Legendary Defender confirmed that one of the main characters , Tak<strong>ashi “Shiro” Shirogane had a male significant other.</strong> The next episode of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations airs on 16 August on TV Tokyo.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Naruto villain Orochimaru has come out as gender non-binary. By</strong> Matt Moore.</p><h2>Is Orochimaru gender neutral?</h2><p>As of the new series,<strong> Oro </strong>chimaru has been confirmed to be genderfluid<strong> and is referred to with gender neutral pronouns.</strong></p><p><strong>Orochimaru was born a male.</strong> Throughout the years he has taken over men and women’s bodies. So he is both but also none.</p><p>I<strong> can see using he/him</strong> for<strong> orochimaru</strong> in the naruto era and they/them or he/they for boruto era, if not they/them or he/they for everything. they clearly give genderfluid self-descriptors during boruto so they/them should be included as their pronouns. whether or not orochimaru would considered themself genderfluid vs, say, nonbinary, though, I don’t know (disclaimer that I’m cis so apologies for any unintended assumptions made)</p><p>I would refrain from making any personal edits that are not stated. IIRC, the fact that<strong> Orochimaru has used both male and female bodies</strong> for his living corpse reincarnation is already mentioned. Also, I believe this exact discussion was already had on Orochimaru’s talkpage, or somewhere else on the wiki, so please look there to see the consensus.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGigrGWfp7yktMimmKutXZZ6rq3LnmSoql2bsq6ty55kcmhjbX1w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-orochimaru-a-male-or-female-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-taika-waititi-jewish-his-ancestry-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-taika-waititi-jewish-his-ancestry-explained.html>Is Taika Waititi Jewish?
