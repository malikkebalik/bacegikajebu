<time>12 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As a proud member of Generation Y, many of my nostalgic reveries include the quality programming that was bestowed upon me courtesy of Nickelodeon. Thanks to things like<a href=# class=T3D> YouTube and Netflix</a>, '90s kids can revisit several of these beloved programs in a <a href=# class=T3D>binge-watching session</a> of the ages. Many fans remember Melissa Joan Hart breaking down life lessons in <i><a href=# class=T3D>Clarissa Explains It All</a>, </i>campfire stories from <i><a href=# class=T3D>Are You Afraid of the Dark</a>? </i>that were scary enough to make you sleep with the lights on, and the fact that <i>All That </i>really <i>was </i>all that. Nestled within these hits was the popular — yet somewhat underrated — western comedy, <i>Hey Dude. </i>The show centered on a group of teenagers working at a ranch called the Bar None, which was owned by the genial — and delightfully eccentric — Mr. Ernst.</p><p>Along with coaxing us all to take up horseback riding lessons, the series was full of uproarious antics, heartwarming moments, #FriendshipGoals, and even a love triangle (more on that in a bit).</p><p>It has been over 25 years since the series graced our respective television screens, and I think it is high-time we check in on the actors who portrayed such memorable characters. Some of the cast from <i>Hey Dude </i>decided to exit the entertainment field following the show's cancellation, while others went on to stardom. Many cast members are barely recognizable (hey, two decades changes a lot), but I submit you will be just as happy to see the crew today as you were back in 1989.</p><h3>1. David Brisbin</h3><p>Brisbin played the Mr. Ernst, who owned the Bar None dude ranch. An affable boss, his over-the-top antics and zeal often frazzled his employees as hilarity would ensue. Here's what Brisbin looked like during his <i>Hey Dude </i>days:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Nice. Here's what the actor looks like now:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Brisbin's <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>most recent acting credit</a> is a guest appearance on the FX hit, <i>Justified. </i>He also appeared on <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, <i>Brothers & Sisters</i>, and <i>Bones</i>, among other series. Clearly, Mr. Ernst is looking a bit more stoic these days.</p><h3>2. Debra Kalman</h3><p>Kalman played Lucy, the authoritative ranch hand at Bar None. <i>Someone </i>had to keep everybody in line, amiright? Here's what Kalman looked like during her <i>Hey Dude </i>days:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Love that hat! Here's what the former actress looks like now:</p><p>According to UPROXX, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kalman no longer works as an actress</a>, but returned to teaching after some brief acting stints following her Nickelodeon fame. She did, however, reunite with some <i>Hey Dude </i>alums during the 2014 ATX Festival in Austin, Texas.</p><h3>3. Christine Taylor</h3><p>Taylor played girl-next-door Melody, who was <i>my </i>personal favorite. Check out her on fleek attempts at flirting, complete with propositions of orange soda and a faux backstory below, as well her <i>Hey Dude</i> look:</p><p></p><p>So much nostalgia. Here's the actress now:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Taylor went on to have a successful acting career and is currently married to Ben Stiller. She starred alongside her beau in the mega-hit film, <i>Zoolander, </i>and is slated to reprise her role in the sequel.</p><h3>4. Joe Torres</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Due to the fact that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Torres completely fell off the grid</a> following <i>Hey Dude, </i>there are no current confirmed photos of the actor who played Danny Lightfoot. Hopefully, wherever Torres is, he's doing well.</p><h3>5. Kelly Brown</h3><p>Brown played spunky Brad, who may have been the best horse rider on the ranch. Here's what the Bar None employee looked like during her <i>Hey Dude </i>days:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Brown left acting to marry her high school sweetheart and start a family after the show wrapped. She discussed what she has been up to during an interview with <i>HuffPost Live, </i>which includes owning three different businesses in New York. Impressive!</p><p></p><h3>6. David Lascher</h3><p>Lascher played mischievous troublemaker, Ted, who alternated between aggravating and enchanting Brad — #RelationshipGoals. Here's what the lovable instigator looked like during his <i>Hey Dude </i>days:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Adorable — yet cunning. Here's what the actor looks like now:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Rachel Murray/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Since his Nickelodeon days, Lascher has appeared on several series, including <i>Sabrina, The Teenage Witch</i>, and <i>Melissa & Joey.</i></p><h3>7. Jonathan Galkin</h3><p>Galkin was cast as Mr. Ernst's nephew, Jake Decker, from Los Angeles during Lascher's brief reprieve from the show. Here's what the actor looked like during his <i>Hey Dude </i>days:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Here's what Galkin looks like today:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Galkin attended the ATX reunion with other cast members and also discussed <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>what he's been up</a> to during an interview with Scott Rogowsky of RunningLateShow. Unlike other cast members, his love of acting ended up waning, so he chose a different career route.</p><p></p><p><i>Images: Nickelodeon (8); FX; YouTube</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZBvanJlpJ2ybrTEsmSdrZSaeqSt0q1kpaefoMBuw8CyZJ2hlpuys7HNrWStoJGjerW0xLJknaGUYrG2vsinnmasmJq2s3nNopqknZyksaa7zWabmrGj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html>What Is LaRoyce Hawkins' Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jesse-r-weigand-fulton-teacher-arrested-for-stealing-school-property.html>Jesse R.
