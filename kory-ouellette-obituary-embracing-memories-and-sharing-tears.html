Get the facts on the vehicle crash that happened in Salem, Massachusetts. At at 6:18 p.m., Salem law enforcement received a call reporting the catastrophic collision.</p><p>They found that a car had slammed into the fence of a house on Puritan Road upon their arrival. The driver, the only occupant, tragically passed away from his wounds there and then. Kory Ouellette, a local resident of Salem, has been named as the victim by law enforcement.</p><p>Someone who was there testified that he soothed the driver in their final minutes. Vinny Valenti, a witness, said that he had grasped the driver‚Äôs hand and told them to keep breathing. Valenti, a handyman, was remodelling an adjacent building when he heard the noise. He responded quickly and went to help others who needed it.</p><p>Valenti claimed that a 12-foot pole that was part of the fence‚Äôs top had smashed through the car‚Äôs windshield.<br>The pole entered the car through the rear window and exited through the driver‚Äôs neck.</p><h2>Kory Ouellette Obituary</h2><p><strong>According to reports, a 20-year-old guy from Salem was killed in a single-vehicle accident late on Sunday (27 Aug).</strong> When a major incident occurred on Puritan Road at 6:18 p.m., Salem police officers responded. WCVB CCTV shows an SUV crashing into a fence in front of a house. There‚Äôs a big crack in the windshield. Kory Ouellette, the driver from Salem, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities.</p><p>Vinny Valenti, a builder working on a house next door, reported hearing a loud boom and spoke to NBC10 Boston about it. Valenti was quoted by the news site saying:</p><p>‚ÄúI ran out and there was a whole 12-foot pole, the top of the fence, it went through the windshield, through his neck, and out the back window.‚Äù</p><p>He was unable to unlock the driver‚Äôs phone to call his family, so he instead held Ouellette‚Äôs hand in the passenger seat until an ambulance arrived.</p><p><strong>You can take a look at the below tweet about Kory Ouellette‚Äôs passing:</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It is with great sadness to hear about the passing of Kory. Unbelievably tragic. We are praying for his family, especially his brother Kyle and parents Steve and Maureen Ouellette. We are praying for you and wishing you peace and strength. üôè <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FszIiPMNOt</a></p><p>‚Äî St.Marys Baseball (@smhbb10) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 29, 2023</a></p><p>Kid, take a deep breath. Valenti was cited by NBC10. The Massachusetts State Police Accident Reconstruction Team and the Salem Police Criminal Investigation Division are conducting the investigation. Ouellette, who will graduate from Lynn St. Mary‚Äôs in 2021, is an avid ice hockey photographer. The middle school team coached by Mark Lee won the 2016-2017 state championship in Division 1.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at other celebrities‚Äô obituary details we have covered about passing:</strong></p><h2>What is Kory Ouellette Cause Of Death?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kory-Ouellette.jpg><p><strong>The deceased 20-year-old has been identified as Kory Ouellette, and his death was the result of a crash involving a single car.</strong> In most cases, a ‚Äúsingle vehicle incident‚Äù describes a collision in which no one from another vehicle was hurt.</p><p>However, if bystanders or cyclists who were not engaged in the collision were injured, then the incident would also be classified as a single-vehicle accident. Collisions involving only one vehicle do not include those in which external property, such as a building or an empty car, is damaged.</p><p>Police have not commented on whether or not speed was a factor in the collision, but eyewitnesses in the area have told me that they don‚Äôt think it was.
