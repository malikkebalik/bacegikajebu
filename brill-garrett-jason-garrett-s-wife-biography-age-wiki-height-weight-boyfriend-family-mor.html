He served from 2011 to 2019 as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Mrs. Garrett is a literacy advocate, a public figure, and even a popular woman, unlike many other celebrity wives. One blessed lady to share her life with her beloved husband is a Harvard graduate. Aside from that, in their residence in Dallas, Texas, the two now live a luxurious life.</p><p>Born on the 8th of December 1965. She looks amazing with her blue colored eyes and her hair of blonde color and has maintained herself quite well even at this age with her amazing body figure measurement of 36-27-36. Her height is 5 feet 8 inches and her weight is 60 kg approximately.</p><table width=607><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td width=448>December 8, 1965</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td width=448>58 Years</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Height</td><td width=448 readability=5>In Centimetres – 173 cm<p>In Feet and Inches – 5′ 8″</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Weight</td><td width=448>In Kilograms – 60 Kg<p>In Pounds -132 lbs</p></td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td width=448>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td width=448>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Figure Measurements</td><td width=448>36-27-36</td></tr><tr><td>Bra Size</td><td width=448>34B</td></tr><tr><td>Dress Size</td><td width=448>6 (US)</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td width=448>8 (US)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Although Brill Garrett is married to one of the richest athletes and a famous football coach, she has made sure that she has her own place when it comes to her financial situation and has earned a lot of wealth through her career as a literacy advocate.</p><p>She has kept her professional life private and has not shared her experience as a lawyer. The total net worth estimated for Brill Garrettis $500 thousand US dollars as of now.</p><p>Brill Garrett was born and raised in Illinois, United States of America.

She is an advocate of literacy and has received a law degree from Harvard University. She teamed up with the former First Lady, Laura Bush, back in 2018 and organized the ‘Worth Celebration of Reading’ initiative.</p><p>Apart from this, there are not many specifics about her professional life. Sometime in 1994, when Jason was still playing as a player and was with the Miami Dolphins, the couple tied the knot. Likewise, only their loved ones attended their private wedding ceremony. The happy couple has been together for almost 25 years, as of now.</p><p>Taking aside their marriage, their history dates back to their student days when they were both studying at the prestigious University of Princeton. The couple met for the first time during their geology class.</p><p>It was clear from the very beginning that Brill had a huge crush on Jason and it took a great deal of bravery for her to approach him. Yet her dedication paid off in the end. In 1988, they graduated from Princeton together.</p><p>For around a decade, Brill and Jason dated as they both sought higher education and worked to develop their respective careers, until eventually tying the knot in 1994. The ceremony was very small and personal, with only the participation of close family and friends.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481>Jason Garrett</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td width=481 readability=5>Jason Garrett<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-1-3-300x160.jpg></p></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td width=481>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Brill Aldrige’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=1.8269230769231><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Keanu Reeves</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350><a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Scarlett Johansson" href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a></td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Colour</td><td width=350>Red</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Holiday Destinations</td><td width=350>Paris</td></tr><tr><td>favorite food</td><td width=350>Italian Cuisine</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Reading and Watching Football Games</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Brill also partnered with Laura Bush (Former First Lady) as a literacy advocate to host the Dallas, Fort Worth Celebration of Reading in 2018.</li></ul><ul><li>The event was held in Dallas, Texas, on November 6th, 2018.</li></ul><ul><li>About 140 family literacy services were supported by the ceremony.</li></ul><ul><li>In 1997, she and her husband also founded the Jason Garrett Starfish Charities charitable foundation.</li></ul><ul><li>Brill Garrett is a very private individual and on different social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Facebook, she has no official accounts.</li></ul><ul><li>The wife of Jason Garrett has a brother named Jeff Aldridge.</li></ul><ul><li>In addition, in November 2019, her father, Jeffrey Aldridge, passed away.
