It all seems very unfortunate.” Swift called him out on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tumblr</a> for his “incessant, manipulative bullying” both before and after the masters controversy.</p><p id=par-5_30>“The thing that struck me the worst is the word ‘bully,’” Braun said said. “I’m firmly against anyone ever being bullied. I always try to lead with appreciation and understanding.”</p><p id=par-6_57>Braun believed it was all a misunderstanding between the two parties. “I think when you’re successful, you are misunderstood,” he said. “There’s always going to be misconceptions because people want to see things the way they want to see them. But it would be really nice if we all give each other a little bit of grace.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scooter-braun-regrets-how-it-all-happened>Scooter Braun regrets how it all happened</h2><p id=par-7_34>Braun eventually sold Taylor Swift’s masters to the private equity firm Shamrock Holdings for a reported $405 million. he opened up about his remorse for the situation in a 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>.</p><p id=par-8_43>“The regret I have there is that I made the assumption that everyone, once the deal was done, was going to have a conversation with me, see my intent, see my character and say, ‘great, let’s be in business together,’” Braun said.</p><p id=par-9_122>He spoke about some of the things he learned from the deal. “When I did that deal, I was under a very strict NDA with [Big Machine owner <a href=#>Scott Borchetta</a>], and I couldn’t tell any artist. I wasn’t allowed to. I wasn’t legally allowed to,” he said. “What I told him was, ‘Hey, if any of the artists want to come back and buy into this, you have to let me know.’ And he shared a letter with me that’s out there publicly that – you know, the artist you’re referring to said, ‘I don’t want to participate in my masters. I’ve decided to, you know, not make this deal,’ blah, blah, blah. So that was the idea I was under.”</p><p id=par-10_94>“I was excited to work with every artist on the label. So when we finalized the deal, I started making phone calls to say, ‘hey, I’m a part of this.’ And before I could even do that – I made four phone calls; I started to do those phone calls – all hell broke loose,” he went on. “So I think a lot of things got lost in translation. I think that when you have a conflict with someone, it’s very hard to resolve it if you’re not willing to have a conversation.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-is-re-recording-her-first-6-albums>Taylor is re-recording her first 6 albums</h2><p id=par-11_63>In the end, Swift will have new masters of her own — and has been setting new records in the process. She released the <a href=#>re-recorded albums</a> Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) in 2021, and with <a href=#>“All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version),”</a> Swift notched the longest song to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTApLvOrZyrZZKnrra6jKucoKqVqcBuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZp2erZRirqfAxKtkrJ2cobavs4yhnKtlnZbAtbHRrGWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscooter-braun-regrets-his-taylor-swift-feud-after-selling-her-masters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-5th-entry-in-a-franchise-you-didn-t-even-know-had-sequels-breathes-fire-on-streaming.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-5th-entry-in-a-franchise-you-didn-t-even-know-had-sequels-breathes-fire-on-streaming.html>The 5th entry in a franchise you didnt even know had sequels breathes fire on streaming</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hong-kong-cruise-best-cruises-from-hong-kong.html>Hong Kong Cruise: Best Cruises from Hong Kong</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hong-kong-cruise-best-cruises-from-hong-kong.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
