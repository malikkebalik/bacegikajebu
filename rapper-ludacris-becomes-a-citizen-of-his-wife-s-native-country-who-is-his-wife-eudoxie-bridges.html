He’s visited the country often for career and personal reasons, as his wife, Eudoxie Bridges, is a native of Gabon.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1026511316.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Eudoxie Bridges?</strong></h2><p id=par-2_50>Ludacris is one of the top rappers and actors in the game but his wife comes with her own impressive resume. She was born and raised in West Africa. <a href=#>According to Entity Magazine</a>, she struggled with poverty and abuse and immigrated to the U.S. with very little experience speaking English.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-3_37>Her language barrier was not a hindrance. She succeeded academically and obtained both her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. She was studying at the University of Miami to become a doctor and graduated, though she doesn’t currently practice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_79>She and Ludacris began dating in 2009. They hit a rough patch in 2014 when it was leaked that <a href=#>Ludacris impregnated another woman</a> during their relationship, causing speculation as to whether or not he and Eudoxie were together at the time of his affair. Either way, they reconciled and he made his love known in a massive way by proposing during a helicopter ride. They married on Christmas Eve 2014 and welcomed their daughter, Cadence, a few months later.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-5_34><a href=#>Rolling Out reported</a> that Eudoxie addressed the scandal in July 2019.

In December 2019, he visited Ghana to join in the Year of Return celebrations, part of a campaign encouraging people of African descent, whose ancestors were victims of the transatlantic slave trade, to return to Ghana.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-10>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-14_62>He shared photos of the experience on his Instagram account with his followers along with the caption, “Our ancestors never gave up faith.

The chains have been broken and the indomitable resilience of African people triumphs #yearofthereturn.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-11>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-15_4>Congrats to the Bridges!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2ForzPnqlmpKWZrqS%2ByKxkm52TpLqmv4yaZJyhpJ7HprqMqJ1moJmoeri1xZ6qZqaRqba3sYycpq6mpKfGbsPHqGSiq12dtrR51qKdnmWVqrGwxMieZJuqmZm0pr%2BNoaumpF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frapper-ludacris-becomes-a-citizen-of-his-wife-s-native-country-who-is-his-wife-eudoxie-bridges.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-downloader-world-app-and-how-to-install-it.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-downloader-world-app-and-how-to-install-it.html>What is Downloader.world App And How to Install It?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kenya-moore-slams-bravo-culture-as-toxic-following-sudden-departure-from-the-real-housewives-of-a.html>Kenya Moore Slams Bravo Culture as 'Toxic' Following Sudden Departure From 'The Real Housewives of A</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kenya-moore-slams-bravo-culture-as-toxic-following-sudden-departure-from-the-real-housewives-of-a.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
