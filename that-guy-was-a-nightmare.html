He only lost six matches over the course of his career and won 44 of his fights by knockout. As Foreman would admit in a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ESPN</a>, Tyson’s fearsome fighting style terrified everybody in the boxing world.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_49>“I call him Mike Nightmare Tyson, that guy was a nightmare in the ring,” Foreman said. “I mean really. If he missed you with his left, then missed you with his right, he’d bite you. I didn’t want to have anything to do with that. I didn’t want him.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-he-says-mike-tyson-was-scared-of-him-too>He says Mike Tyson was scared of him too&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_28>Even though Foreman knew he didn’t want to step into the ring with Tyson, he also knew that Tyson was afraid of him for two reasons in particular.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_83>“I could really punch, and of course, I was an expert at punching downward,” Foreman, who stands six foot four, said. “My manager would hold a bag and he was down there, so I learned to really develop power from punches [for] guys who were down low. He was smart enough to understand that. As they got taller, my manager was not taller, so there was a deficiency there. But Tyson was very smart. Cus D’Amato and Tyson were a smart team, period.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_15>Later in the interview, Foreman again admitted that he never wanted to take on Tyson.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_55>“That Mike Tyson was a monster. He was a monster,” Foreman reiterated. “Those are the kind of guys you see in a nightmare, and you wonder, ‘Wake up, wake up, wake up!’ And you wake up and say, ‘Phew, so glad that was a dream.’ I didn’t want any part of Mike Tyson. No way.”</p><h2 id=h-george-foreman-thinks-mike-tyson-was-one-of-the-greatest-of-all-time>George Foreman thinks Mike Tyson was one of the greatest of all time</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_32>Despite fearing his in-ring abilities, Foreman had a deep respect for Tyson. He loved Tyson’s commitment to his technique and considers Tyson to be one of the best to ever do it.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_55>“I really admired Mike Tyson … he wasn’t that tall, that big, but he could hit you quick, real quick, and his footwork was outstanding as well,” Foreman added. “In his prime, there was nothing like him. If he had fought for another four years, winning, I would’ve put him number two to Joe Lewis.”</p><p id=par-12_25>Today, Foreman loves the way Tyson has been able to turn his life around. He thinks Tyson is somebody that everyone can draw inspiration from.</p><p id=par-13_59>“I love him because he’s strictly positive,” Foreman said. “He’s got nothing to say negative about anything. He’s having fun with life, and that’s what it’s really about anyway. Have some fun, get out … Mike Tyson is a great guy to look at. Look at his life. What a book, when he’s ready to write his own book.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0prvRoJxmnp%2Bnsq6tzWamp5uVYq6lucitq56cXZ2ybsPAp6uenF2jvG68wKurrGWfm3qutcqeZK2xo6S7bsDHmqtmn6Wuerit0maYZqaZnLW1ucCrnGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthat-guy-was-a-nightmare.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-connor-goes-missing-claire-rescues-adam-s-son-and-earns-u.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-connor-goes-missing-claire-rescues-adam-s-son-and-earns-u.html>The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Connor Goes Missing Claire Rescues Adams Son and Earns U</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stephen-ross-family-family-tree.html>Stephen Ross Family, Family Tree</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stephen-ross-family-family-tree.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
