Roles such as these helped put Matthew on the map, and they fueled a sustainable acting career well into the modern era. Today, he is probably best known among younger audiences as <a href=# title="Shaggy Net Worth">Shaggy</a> from various "Scooby-Doo" films. He also serves as the voice of Shaggy in various Scooby-Doo animated projects.</p><p>Although Lillard established himself as a comedic actor at the beginning of his career, he later gravitated towards a number of more dramatic roles.

However, he continued to appear in comedic projects like "The Groomsmen" and "Without a Paddle" during the 2000s. In addition to his film work, he is known for appearing in series like "Good Girls." Outside of his acting career, Lillard has directed films like "Fat Kid Rules the World."</p><p>In May 2012, Matthew did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) interview on Reddit. A user asked him about his net worth and Lillard responded with the following:</p><p><strong>"I have three kids and a moderate size house. I do what I love, I'm proud of my life, i wouldn't change itâ€¦ but I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination."</strong></p><p>On the same Reddit thread Lillard stated that he was only paid $1,600 for one week of work on The Descendants.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Matthew Lyn Lillard was born on January 24th of 1970 in Lansing, Michigan.

When it was released in 1995, the film grossed almost $29 million on a budget of $6.5 million. This was seen as a commercial failure, and the film also received mixed reviews.
