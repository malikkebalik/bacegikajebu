<time>09 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It is official guys, <strong>TVXQ’s Changmin</strong> is getting married this September. He has already made plans to tie the knot with his current girlfriend, whose name and whereabouts are kept a secret for safety concerns.</p><p>Changmin, whose real name is <strong>Choi Chang-min,</strong> is the youngest member of the South-Korean boy band,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> TVXQ</a>. Fans know him as Max, but while acting, he goes by his real name. The South Korean group rose to fame back in mid-2000 and has a huge fan following, especially in South Korea and Japan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/changmin-003.jpg><p>On June 12, Friday, his agency, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SM Entertainment</a>, confirmed the news with an official statement just a while ago.</p><h3>“MAX Changmin will be getting married to his current girlfriend on September 5.</h3><h3>To respect the fiancée, who is a non-celebrity, as well as the families of both sides, we will be keeping specific details such as the location and time of the wedding private; we ask for the fans’ and the news reporters’ understanding.”</h3><p>As mentioned above, the agency has kept the personal details under the dark. It is a safe move considering the TVXQ’s history with crazy fans and events that put their lives in danger.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronen Rubinstein Age, Movies, 911, Love Life, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><h3>“Changmin will continue to promote as a member of TVXQ and an artist of our agency without change. Please send your congratulations toward Changmin, awaiting a new beginning in his life. Thank You.”</h3><p>Moreover, the agency also clarified that Changmin would continue his activity with the group. This does not mean he is retiring or leaving the group; fans be assured.</p><h2>TVXQ’s Changmin Also Wrote a Handwritten Letter To His Fans</h2><p>Right after the news broke out, many fans were excited about the story, while some were bawling over the loss of one more fine bachelor. (Trust us, it happens!)</p><p>And being the gentleman he is, Changmin wrote a handwritten letter to address his fans, asking for their love and support. As a matter of fact, the beloved star wanted to deliver the good news himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/changmin-004.jpg><p>The letter was posted in their fan community Lynn where he stated he and his partner “shared trust and belief with each other” and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.</p><h3>“It has been 17 years since I debuted as a singer. Within that time, a young and imperfect high school student has become a man in his mid-30s.”</h3><p>Of course, he reminisced about his early time in TVXQ, with the members and their fans.</p><h3>“I have spent almost half of my life as a member of TVXQ. There were times when we weren’t sure of the future of TVXQ, but your fans stood by us and gave us such big love that has allowed me to grow into who I am. I thank you so much.”</h3><p>He continued,</p><h3>“I realize that the path I am about to take requires more responsibility than ever before. So I will be a member of a new family and a member of TVXQ, who does his best at every moment and every job, and pay back the love to people who support me.”</h3><p>You can read the original letter right below.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexi Underwood Age, Height, Parents, Movies, Navia Robinson, Instagram >></a></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/changmin-002.jpg><h2>How Are Fans Reacting Over The News?</h2><p>Compared to other dating scandals we have seen over the years, fans of TVXQ and Changmin are reacting more positively to the news. In fact, most of them are ecstatic that their favorite idol is getting married and will no longer be alone.</p><p>Similarly, many went straight to Twitter and shown their support, trending the news worldwide. So, now even international fans are thrilled and are congratulating the 32-year-old idol.</p><p>Since last year the South Korean artist has been dating his mystery girlfriend and publicly announced it back then too. Hence the reason why fans are taking it positively.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dakota Chapman Wiki, Age, Height, Career, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Also, he did admit to dating non-celebrity. You can see social media swarmed with messages right now.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve been a fan of TVXQ since 2008. Rmb how they’ve talked about seeing fans come to their concerts as teens and as adults and then eventually with their families? It’s their turn now. Changmin, congrats on finding someone who makes you happy. 진심으로 축하해요 창민아❤️</p><p>— 🍓hiatus 🍑 (@snxy) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">June 12, 2020</a></p><p>https://twitter.com/dongbangfinite/status/1271354946059792386</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK5706%2BvqqtdmLWiusamoKdlmah6qLHTraCnn12irrO%2ByJ6bZqyYnsBuv8Spq56lkpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftvxq-s-changmin-is-getting-married-this-september.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vikram-lal-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vikram-lal-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Vikram Lal Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-most-popular-christmas-song-ever.html>The Most Popular Christmas Song Ever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-most-popular-christmas-song-ever.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
