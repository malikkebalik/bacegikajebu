<time>04 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wiki.celebrity.fm/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-Did-Etta-James-Think-Of-Cadillac-Records.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>In 2008, James was portrayed by Beyoncé Knowles in the film Cadillac Records, a fictional account of Chess Records, James’s label for 18 years, and how label founder and producer Leonard Chess helped the careers of James and others. The film portrayed her pop hit “At Last”.</p><p>Of course we all saw Beyonce’s “role” in the movie Cadillac Records but unfortunately that role was not the factual life of Etta James. For those of you who’ve never read the the autobiography of Etta James, Rage To Survive, I strongly encourage you to check out this book.</p><p>However in truth, Etta herself wrote these lines with Jordan. Even though Etta didn’t considered herself a “professional” songwriter at the time, this song heralded the depths of her experience with undeniable emotion which very well paralleled a violent relationship she didn’t know how to leave and a drug problem she didn’t know how to kick.</p><p>Etta James. Etta James (born Jamesetta Hawkins; January 25, 1938 – January 20, 2012) was an American singer who performed in various genres, including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. Starting her career in 1954, she gained fame with hits such as ” The Wallflower “, ” At Last “, ” Tell Mama “,</p><h2>Who was Etta’s relationship with?</h2><p>During Etta’s early days at Chess, she was very open in having a relationship with<strong> Harvey Fuqua,</strong> member of the Moonglows and later played a pivotal role in the formation of Motown Records.</p><p>Well, that’s a good question especially when Ms. James’s book was published in<strong> 1995,</strong> 13 years “before” the release of the movie, Cadillac Records. What is also in question is why writer/director, Darnell Martin would write the role of Etta James with Beyonce in mind as stated in the New York Times.</p><p>While Etta wondered much about the true identity of her father, most of her issues of rejection and insecurity stemmed from her mother,<strong> Dorothy,</strong> a single teenage mother who traveled in and out of Etta’s life like a bad storm.</p><p>According to Marshall Chess, son of<strong> Leonard Chess,</strong> he had these words to say concerning the issue of this affair: “Now, my father was no angel, but (he) was never caught in an affair,” Chess said. “It never happened.”. He even asked James, a longtime friend, and she told him, “He kissed me on the cheek once.”. …</p><h2>Who produced Etta James’s album?</h2><p>James continued to record for Chess (now owned by All Platinum Records ), releasing one more album in 1976, Etta Is Betta Than Evvah! Her 1978 album Deep in the Night, produced by<strong> Jerry Wexler</strong> for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire.</p><p>In 1963, she had another major hit with “Pushover” and released the live album Etta James Rocks the House, recorded at the New Era Club<strong> in Nashville, Tennessee.</strong> After a couple of years of minor hits, James’s career started to suffer after 1965.</p><p>On her 2004 release, Blue Gardenia, she returned to a jazz style. Her final album for<strong> Private Music, Let’s Roll,</strong> released in 2005, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked her number 62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>James believed that King’s hit single “Sweet Sixteen” was about her. In early 1955, she and an aspiring singer, the<strong> 19-year-old</strong> Elvis Presley, then recording for Sun Studios and an avid fan of King’s, shared a bill in a large club just outside Memphis.</p><p>She faced a number of personal problems, including<strong> heroin addiction, severe physical abuse, and incarceration,</strong> before making a musical comeback in the late 1980s with the album Seven Year Itch. James’s powerful, deep, earthy voice bridged the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll.</p><p>A Christmas album, Etta James Christmas, was released in<strong> 1998.</strong> By the mid-1990s, James’s earlier classic music was being used in commercials, including ” I Just Wanna Make Love to You “. After an excerpt of the song was featured in a Diet Coke advertising campaign in the UK, it reached the top ten on the UK charts in 1996.</p><p>James ventured into rock and funk with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer<strong> Gabriel Mekler,</strong> who had worked with Steppenwolf and Janis Joplin, who had admired James and had covered “Tell Mama” in concert.</p><h2>Who is the actor in Cadillac Records?</h2><p>Starring<strong> Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, Beyonc Knowles and Cedric the Entertainer.</strong> Opens Friday. Cadillac Records begins with Dixon laying the foundation of the story, introducing us to “one white boy from Chicago” (Chess, first seen mid-coitus) and “one sharecropper from Mississippi” (Waters, tilling the soil).</p><p>Martin tells the story elliptically with the occasional bold proclamation (“I don’t know what the fuck it is,” Chess says of Waters’ music,<strong> “but I’m recording it!” </strong>) inserted here and there to remind us that these small stars are, in fact, portraying larger-than-life musicians whose work would influence generations.</p><h2>Who is Etta James?</h2><p>Etta James is<strong> a Grammy Award-winning singer</strong> known for hit songs like “I’d Rather Go Blind” and “At Last.”.</p><p>James’ work gained positive attention from critics as well as fans, and her<strong> 1973</strong> album Etta James earned a Grammy nomination, in part for its creative combination of rock and funk sounds. After completing her contract with Chess in 1977, James signed on with Warner Brothers Records.</p><p>She has also been diagnosed with<strong> dementia and Hepatitis C, </strong>” Dr. Elaine James (not related to the singer) told a local newspaper. James’ sons also acknowledged that Etta’s health was declining and was receiving care at her Riverside, California, home. James died at her home in Riverside, California, on January 20, 2012.</p><p>That same year, James released Let’s Roll, which won the Grammy Award for best contemporary blues album. Her sons,<strong> Donto and Sametto James,</strong> served as producers on the recording, along with<strong> Josh Sklair.</strong></p><p>The story of the early days of Chess Records was brought to the big screen as Cadillac Records in 2008, with singer<strong> Beyoncè Knowles</strong> playing James in the film. Knowles also recorded her own version of James’ signature song, “At Last” for the soundtrack.</p><p>Mills sought to gain control over $1 million of James’ money, but he was challenged by James’ two sons,<strong> Donto and Sametto.</strong> The two parties later worked out an agreement.</p><p>James released her latest studio album, The Dreamer, in<strong> November 2011,</strong> which received warm reviews. A few weeks later, James’ doctor announced that the singer was terminally ill. “She’s in the final stages of leukemia.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYrGqsIyeq62ZXZ%2BurrHSZquhoZ6gerCyjJyYnaGcoa6kedGemqiqlKh6eH%2BVb25o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-did-etta-james-think-of-cadillac-records-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-young-conan-o-brien-plays-an-obnoxious-customer-in-80s-training-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-young-conan-o-brien-plays-an-obnoxious-customer-in-80s-training-video.html>A Young Conan OBrien Plays An Obnoxious Customer in 80s Training Video!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./patrik-antonius-s-wife-who-is-patrik-antonius-dating.html>Patrik Antoniuss Wife: Who is Patrik Antonius Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./patrik-antonius-s-wife-who-is-patrik-antonius-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
