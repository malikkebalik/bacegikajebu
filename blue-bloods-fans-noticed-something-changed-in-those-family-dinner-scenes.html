<time>17 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_39>The family dinner scenes are a fan favorite on Blue Bloods. So it’s hard to change anything about them without fans noticing. There was recently a change made that have people talking. Here is what they noticed and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Reagans have a family dinner every week because of Betty Reagan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blue-Bloods-Jamie-and-Eddie.jpg><p id=par-2_24>One of the police show’s staples is having the Reagan family have dinner together every episode. It has been revealed how this tradition started.</p><p id=par-3_32>Jamie (Will Estes) told Eddie (Vanessa Ray) in the episode, “By Hook or by Crook” that they have family dinners “Because my grandmother grew up poor in a small town in Ireland.”</p><p id=par-4_58>He continued, “She was the oldest of 12 kids and there was never enough to eat. She moved to New York to make money. She met my grandpa and when they got married she promised herself that they would always have more than enough to eat. Family dinner was just her way of proudly proving that every week.”</p><p id=par-5_18>The dinner tradition has continued and that’s not the only tradition that has been important to the family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Going to church is also a Reagan tradition</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_34>The Reagan family is Catholic and talk about religion often. When Jamie and Eddie were planning their wedding, the future bride asked at dinner if there were any traditions they should keep in mind.</p><p id=par-7_39>“Well, church,” answered Erin (Bridget Moynahan). Henry (Lou Cariou) suggested a specific one. “Why not St. Andrews?&nbsp;I got married there. We go to church there every Sunday. That’s about as strong a family tradition as you could ask for.”</p><p id=par-8_23>So family dinners and following their religion are two traditions the Reagans have kept. However, fans noticed something has changed on the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans noticed the Reagans don’t say grace at dinner starting from Season 8</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_23>The Reagans continued their family tradition of dinner in the later seasons. However, fans did noticed that something was off in Season 8.</p><p id=par-10_33>The family members didn’t say grace, which is weird timing considering that’s the season that picks up after Linda’s death. The seating around the table also had to change because of her absence.</p><p id=par-11_28>“<a href=#>The seat change I get since they had to write out Linda</a> but stopping the prayer is unacceptable. #BlueBloods,” a fan tweeted according to Pop Culture.</p><p id=par-12_27>Another fan tweeted, “Fell asleep. Didn’t realize that the prayers had been removed. Not good. What makes the family strong is their faith.But, hey don’t mind me.”</p><p id=par-13_55>Although this change started last season fans are still noticing it. In the episode, “Two-Faced” the family has dinner. The scene started with Erin saying, “I know we just said grace,” before talking about how grateful she is for the family. After the episode ended, fans were commenting under the show’s tweet questioning the change.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>Another excellent one! Eddie needs to give Jamie a break; no inside track for her. Just curious about the family saying Grace – were there complaints in the past? Tonight it was just mentioned, not shown recently???? It should be part of what the Regans are about??</p>— June Cleaver (@junecleavertoo) <a href=#>March 16, 2019</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-5 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/christi88762586/status/1106787959418880000</p></figure><p id=par-14_40>It has yet to be revealed why the show changed the family dinner scenes. Perhaps the prayers were cut for time, or maybe there was some feedback on including them. Either way, the Reagan tradition has had a new twist.</p><p id=par-15_15><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#><strong>‘Blue Bloods’: Why Jamie and Eddie Won’t Have Their Wedding at His Church</strong></a></p><p id=par-16_5>Check out&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvrcHEZpmlp5%2BZwG6ywKeqZqafqbakscNmqqillam1qrrGZpqhmZ6csqV5yKdkraCfqLJussCmoKWxXZm2r7rEq2Ssm5WjsrR6x62kpWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblue-bloods-fans-noticed-something-changed-in-those-family-dinner-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./annie-duke-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./annie-duke-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Annie Duke Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-maite-perroni-dating-maite-perroni-s-boyfriend-exes.html>Who is Maite Perroni Dating Maite Perroni's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-maite-perroni-dating-maite-perroni-s-boyfriend-exes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
