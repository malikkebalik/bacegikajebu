The hospital struggled to stay open for a while. But the residents are back now. The hospital won back its accreditation. Meredith was there to welcome the new class. She was giving an amazing speech when a late resident interrupted her. Meredith reminded Simone Griffin that they expect the unexpected. Griffin like everyone else needed to be at work on time and they needed to make good impressions. She at least didn’t sleep with an attendee. Someone else did. Her name was Jules Millin. Millin’s secret was outed to the rest of the residents by a fellow resident, Mika Yasuda.</p><p>The resident’s first day on the job was to visit the brain trauma unit. Most of the patients were brain dead. It was good news for organ donations, but horrible news for their families and so the residents’ first day consisted of them breaking the news to their loved ones. Millin got to break some good news as well. She got to tell Maggie that Maggie’s patient just got a new heart. Millin is a huge fan of Maggie’s. She even read Maggie’s paper on racial medical issues. So, she was a true fan. Especially as she is white and didn’t need to find out how black patients were struggling to get the proper care they deserve.</p><p>When the residents weren’t fangirling, they were being a little friendly. Lucas Adams was a new resident and he kept listening to conversations he shouldn’t and ignored the conversation that should have taken place. He was supposed to have told a mother that her son was brain dead. He ended up telling someone else’s mother and so the real mother came out of surgery to find out the news for herself. She began yelling at Amelia for unprofessionalism. Adams was in so much trouble. He actually got into worse trouble when the mother of the patient demanded that they run all the tests again to see if her son really was dead.</p><p>Amelia had already notified Meredith earlier that the patient was brain dead. Meredith prepared to donate the patient’s organs to a triple organ donation patient so someone could die in the long term of waiting for the tests to be run again. Adams was apologizing to everyone. He wanted to go down a shame spiral and Dr. Nick Marsh told him to save it until after his shift. Nick was in Seattle for all the organ donations that day. He never stayed to be with Meredith. Meredith sent him back to Minnesota and she never called or texted. And Nick was still hurt by that because he genuinely loved her.</p><p>Meredith did call out his name at the airport only he didn’t turn around. She thought he hadn’t heard her and he had. He admitted that when he later saw her. Things were awkward between them. But there was hope. Take Adams. Adams thought he would get fired and so Nick took pity on him. He included Adams in surgery. Nick was asked by Meredith to perform organ donation surgery on her patient and he took the opportunity to get on Meredith’s good side. Only he wasn’t the reason why Meredith and Amelia watched the surgery. They watched the surgery to see how well Adams was doing.</p><p>Adams was their nephew. He was Amelia’s sister’s son. He was also Derek’s nephew. His favorite nephew and some may say he looks similar to Derek. Meredith didn’t see it, but Amelia did. Adams instead reminded Meredith of Amelia. He was the talented black sheep of his family. He was so Amelia. Derek had been the golden boy. The only boy. He was the man of the house after their father died and he had always been the golden boy. The first bad thing Derek ever did was sleep with a resident. But Link did that as well. He was the one that slept with Millins. He told Jo. Jo told him he should tell Meredith.</p><p>He told Meredith. Meredith told him that he should report the relationship to HR and that he should probably stay away from elevators for a full six months. Link took her advice. He went to HR. They gave a form to fill out. He had to sign it. Millins had to sign it. There was just one problem. Millins refused to sign it. She told Link what they had wasn’t a relationship. It was just one night and she now wants to be friends. Link was fine with that. He never wanted anything more from Millins. He also slept with other people the same week he slept with her and so he was good. He was a little mad that she now thought he was a stalker only he was good.</p><p>It at least gave Jo something to laugh about. Jo had been angry with Schmitt. Schmitt stayed in the hospital as an OBGYN intern and he quickly gave it up the moment the surgical team won back their accreditation. And so Jo was angry at him for abandoning her in OBGYN.</p><p>And Meredith offered Nick a job. She was Chief while Bailey was on sabbatical and so she had the power to offer him a job. She also needed someone to fill her place while she acted as Chief. And Nick told her he’d think about it.</p><p>And Griffith revealed to Richard why she was late to work. Griffith had been born at the hospital and her mother had died there. She had a panic attack when she saw the hospital for herself. And so Richard helped her through it.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnl6eyur%2BMmqWarJ%2Bixm680Z6kop2imnqzscKap2ZpYGJ9d3mRa2SsnZGovK95kHJknqiZqLylsYxqZJ6ulafGtbTIp55moJGoeqS0wKeenpxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-premiere-recap-10-06-22-season-19-episode-1-everything-has-changed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./juan-soto-net-worth-and-salary-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./juan-soto-net-worth-and-salary-2024.html>Juan Soto net worth and salary 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-s-behind-the-squirrel-mask-on-the-masked-singer.html>Whos Behind the Squirrel Mask on the Masked Singer?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-s-behind-the-squirrel-mask-on-the-masked-singer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
