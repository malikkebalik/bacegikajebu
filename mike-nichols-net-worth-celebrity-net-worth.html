Mike Nichols died on November 20, 2014 after suffering from cardiac arrest. He was 83 years old.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Mike Nichols was born as Igor Mikhail Peschkowsky on November 6, 1931 in Berlin, Germany to Brigitte and Pavel. He was of Russian-Jewish and German-Jewish descent, and had a younger brother named Robert. When the Nazis began arresting Jewish people in Berlin in 1939, Nichols and his brother were sent by themselves to the United States, where they joined their refugee father; their mother came a little later. The family subsequently moved to New York City. Becoming a naturalized citizen of the US, Nichols went to PS 87 in Manhattan, and then to the Walden School. For his higher education, Nichols briefly attended New York University, and then enrolled in pre-med at the University of Chicago.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>In Chicago, Nichols became an announcer on the classical music radio station WFMT. He also created a folk music program for the channel entitled "The Midnight Special," which ran on Saturday nights. After hosting the show for two years, he moved back to New York City to study method acting under Lee Strasberg. However, unable to find stage work, he returned to Chicago and accepted an offer to join the Compass Players, an improv comedy group that preceded Chicago's Second City.</p><h2 id=nichols-may><strong>Nichols and May</strong></h2><p>While working with the Compass Players in Chicago, Nichols started doing improv routines with comedian and actress Elaine May, leading to the creation of the comedy duo Nichols and May in 1958. Together, the pair performed live comedy acts and released their routines on record. In 1960, Nichols and May opened the Broadway production "An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May"; its LP recording went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Soon, however, interpersonal tensions drove Nichols and May their separate ways. They reunited later.</p><h2 id=theater-directing><strong>Theater Directing</strong></h2><p>Following his initial split with May, Nichols traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to direct a theatrical production of "The Importance of Being Earnest." In 1963, he had his breakthrough as a theater director with a production of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park," which became a major hit and earned him a Tony Award for Best Director. Nichols went on to direct a string of successful Broadway plays, starting with "Luv" and "The Odd Couple," which won him another Tony Award. Overall, Nichols received 16 Tony nominations over the course of his career, winning eight times. His other Tonys came for "Plaza Suite," "The Prisoner of Second Avenue," "Annie," "The Real Thing," "Monty Python's Spamalot," and "Death of a Salesman." Nichols' other theater credits included "The Real Thing," "Hurlyburly," "Social Security," and "Waiting for Godot."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-181291 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GettyImages-166653900-1.jpg alt="Mike Nichols" width=377 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-181291 class=wp-caption-text>Cindy Ord/Getty Images</p><h2 id=film-directing><strong>Film Directing</strong></h2><p>On the big screen, Nichols had his breakthrough in 1966 with his very first film as director: an adaptation of Edward Albee's play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
