<time>22 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_49><a href=#>Dean Unglert and Caelynn Miller-Keyes</a> are still going strong since the first meeting on <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>. While the couple had a rocky start, they were able to overcome their difficulties and remain totally committed. And they’re getting more candid than ever about their relationship and their future together.</p><p id=par-2_32>While Unglert and Miller-Keyes seem like they’ll eventually get married, it seems Miller-Keyes has yet to meet Unglert’s father. Here’s what he mentioned on his podcast, <a href=#>Help! I Suck at Dating …</a>.</p><h2>Dean Unglert opened up about his family difficulties on ‘The Bachelorette’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_46>Unglert was first featured on Rachel Lindsay’s season of The Bachelorette — and he had quite an emotional hometown date. He explained to Lindsay that his mother died of cancer, and it put a ton of strain on his relationship with the rest of his family.</p><p id=par-4_44>“Things kind of fell apart within the family,” <a href=#>Unglert told Lindsay</a> over dinner. “Both my brothers moved out, my sister moved out, my father was not there very often, so I had the house to myself from 15 to 18. It was very challenging.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_48>Unglert then had a very difficult and emotional conversation with his father during the hometown visits. The Bachelorette star explained to Lindsay that his father converted to Sikh Kundalini yogi and now goes by Paramroop Singh Khalsa. And Lindsay didn’t end up meeting Unglert’s dad during the visit.</p><p id=par-6_31>Unglert had a few tough conversations with his dad caught on camera, though. And the conversation ended with his father telling him he has “one f***ing foot stuck in the past.”</p><h2>Unglert admitted he hasn’t spoken to his dad since he started dating Caelynn Miller-Keyes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dean-Unglert-Caelynn-Miller-Keyes.jpg><p id=par-7_41>Miller-Keyes joined Unglert and Jared Haibon on Unglert’s podcast, and she answered some fan questions. One question that popped up was about Unglert’s dad. Miller-Keyes was asked if she had ever met his father — and she responded with a no.</p><p id=par-8_47>“I have not [met his dad],” Miller-Keyes noted. “And Dean hasn’t met my dad, nor has he met my mom, which will happen at some point. His dad’s not in his life, my dad’s not in my life, so it’s kind of like, what is the point?”</p><p id=par-9_68>“For the record, I haven’t even talked to my dad since I started dating Caelynn,” Unglert added. “So, it’s like, for all he knows, I could be dead somewhere. Or I could be single, or I could be … you know. There’s a million possibilities. I haven’t talked to my dad since February or April of 2018, whatever it was. So, no. She has not met my father.”</p><h2>He claimed to be working on his relationship with his dad in 2018</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_59>While Unglert no longer seems to be in contact with his dad now, it seems he did attempt to salvage their relationship in 2018. <a href=#>People</a> notes he posted a photo to Instagram with his dad along with the caption, “Sometimes the apple actually does fall far from the tree. But at the end of the day, family is family.”</p><p id=par-11_63>Unglert also told People that while his relationship with dad wasn’t much improved since the end of The Bachelorette, he had hope. “We’re working on it, he said. “I think that we just need to both grow up ourselves.” And he also noted that the conversations that occurred on the show were important for them to have. Otherwise, a lot would’ve gone unsaid.</p><p id=par-12_24>We’re not sure what happened in the past few years, but it seems Unglert’s doing just fine without his father in his life.</p><p id=par-13_7>Check out <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqryMnZyapl2qu6i4xKurZqCRqLu1edKppqSdnmLBsHnHoqpmnJGZerS1zZycZpyRqbavs4ycmJ6kqaO7brnIpaOeql2gsrqx0mefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdean-unglert-hasn-t-spoken-to-his-dad-since-dating-caelynn-miller-keyes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-eva-mendes-and-ryan-gosling-get-married-here-s-their-relationship-timeline.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-eva-mendes-and-ryan-gosling-get-married-here-s-their-relationship-timeline.html>Did Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling get married?
