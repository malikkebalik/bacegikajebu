He played with The Smashing Pumpkins from 1988 to 2000 and then again from 2018 to the present.</p><p>The Smashing Pumpkins released their debut studio album Gish in 1991. Their second album, "Siamese Dream," was released in 1993 and reached #1 in the United States. The band's third album, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness," was released in 1995 and reached #1 in four countries including the US.

He is a second-generation Japanese-American, and learned a bit of Japanese while growing up. He attended Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He spent much of his free time playing guitar. After graduating, he completed two years at a local junior college and then enrolled at Loyola University Chicago where he majored in graphic design. He later dropped out of school to pursue his career in music.</p><h2 id=smashing-pumpkins><strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong></h2><p>In 1987, Iha was playing guitar in the Chicago band Snake Train. He met Billy Corgan via a mutual friend. Corgan was in the process of starting a new band, Smashing Pumpkins, and asked Iha to join. The duo performed for the first time live in July 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. The band then became a trio after <a href=#>D'arcy Wretzky</a> joined and later a full band with the addition of <a href=#>Jimmy Chamberlin</a>. The complete band first performed at the Cabaret Metro in October 1988.</p><p>In 1990, Smashing Pumpkins released its first single, "I Am One." Soon after, they signed to Caroline Records. They recorded their debut 1991 studio album "Gish" in Madison, Wisconsin. The album experienced minor success. They began to work on their second album but there was discord within the band, as Corgan had become somewhat controlling and often insisted that he record all the instrumental parts. Despite the internal strife, the second album "Siamese Dream" debuted at number ten on the "Billboard" 200 chart and sold over four million copies in the United States alone.</p><p>The band released their next album, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness," in 1995. It debuted in the top spot on the "Billboard" 200 chart. It was certified double platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It received seven Grammy Award nominations in 1997. Iha wrote and sang on a number of the songs on the album. Generally, he was considered to be the most quiet members of the band but he developed a reputation for himself during live shows as being funny and charismatic. In 2000, Smashing Pumpkins disbanded for the first time and Iha went on to pursue other projects.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-191678 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-128374945.jpg alt="James Iha" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-191678 class=wp-caption-text>Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-other-work><strong>Solo and Other Work</strong></h2><p>Iha had already been working on solo material.

The same year, he worked with Adam Schlesinger to co-produce the folk band America's album "Here & Now." In 2007 he appeared on stage with the Swedish band, the Sounds, and also contributed guitar to a Fountains of Wayne album.</p><p>In 2009, Iha formed a band with a number of other prominent musicians called Tinted Window.

In 2013, he worked with Japanese musician Yukihiro Takahashi. He wrote songs for and performed on Takahashi's album "Life Anew" and also performed as part of Takahashi's band in tours in Japan.</p><p>In 2016, Iha joined Smashing Pumpkins for several shows. Prior to this, there had been a dispute between Iha and the other members of the band over whether he had ever been asked to rejoin after the group initially broke up in 2000. Iha says he was never asked to rejoin. However, this conflict was eventually resolved as Iha rejoined Smashing Pumpkins full time in 2018.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Iha also designs and consults for his men's clothing brand, Vaporize. The brand is a collaboration with the Japanese label, Beams. He has been designing and consulting since 2001.
