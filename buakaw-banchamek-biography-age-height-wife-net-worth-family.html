On March 12, he appeared on a Thai TV talk show to apologize to the fans and explain his disappearance, stating that he had recurring problems in Por. Pramuk Gym since 2009 and felt insulted by the behavior of the management there. He had been scheduled to visit Japan with the Prime Minister <a href=#>Yingluck Shinawatra</a> for an exhibition match but it was canceled in favor of another fight. As a result of the complication, he decided to part ways with the gym. He said"I can stand tough training, but not poor treatment. It is about the mind, not the body,".</p><p>On March 17, 2012, Buakaw's sponsor Yokkao Boxing announced that he would return to training.

He was scheduled to fight Mickael Cornubet at ThaiFight on April 17, 2012.</p><p>On March 30, 2012, Buakaw was prevented from fighting at Thai Fight in April 2012, until he filed a complaint with the Sports Authority of Thailand proving his claims of unfair treatment by Por.

Pramuk."</p><p>Buakaw's first fight after leaving Por Pramuk Gym was a success. He knocked out Rustem Zaripov at 2:45 of the 2nd round with accurate punches. On May 31, 2012, Buakaw told the press that he wanted to end the dispute between him and Por. Pramuk Gym. For a time, Buakaw was seen in jiujitsu, judo, and wrestling classes.

Nevertheless, Buakaw returned to the ring on August 17, 2012, when he defeated Abdoul Toure by way of TKO in round 2.</p><p>Buakaw beat Mauro Serra via TKO in the quarter-finals of the 2012 Thai Fight 70&nbsp;kg Tournament at Thai Fight 2012: King of Muay Thai in Bangkok, Thailand, on October 23, 2012.

Instead he entered the Shoot Boxing World Tournament 2010 along with the former three time tournament champion <a href=#>Andy Souwer</a>. However <a href=#>Toby Imada</a> defeated Souwer in the semi finals to face Buakaw in the final. Buakaw defeated Imada via TKO in the second round to become the new 2010 Shoot Boxing S-Cup World champion.</p><p>Buakaw lost to Masato by unanimous decision at the K-1 World MAX 2007 quarterfinals. Despite Buakaw being able to land vicious leg kicks throughout the match, Masato scored a knockdown in the first round and continued to land numerous punch combinations throughout the fight which earned him a unanimous decision victory.</p><p>In July 2004, Buakaw became the K-1 MAX World champion beating <a href=#>John Wayne Parr</a>, Takayuki Kohiruimaki and previous champion Masato in the finals. In 2005, he nearly repeated his run for tournament champion but lost the extra round in a controversial decision to Dutch shoot-boxer <a href=#>Andy Souwer</a> in the finals. In the 2006 K-1 MAX World Grand Prix, Buakaw again faced <a href=#>Andy Souwer</a> in the finals but this time defeated Souwer by TKO with a flurry of punches; thereby winning his second K-1 World MAX title and becoming the first man to win such title twice.</p><p>Buakaw has collected several belts to his name fighting in Bangkok. The Omnoi Stadium featherweight title was his first belt. After that, he would go on to take the featherweight champion of Thailand title. Buakaw then proceeded to win another Omnoi Stadium title belt, this time in the lightweight division. In December 2002, Buakaw won the Toyota Marathon 140&nbsp;lb. tournament at Lumpinee Boxing Stadium, beating the highly regarded <a href=#>Satoshi Kobayashi</a> of Japan in the finals.</p><p>Sombat Banchamek (Thai: สมบัติ บัญชาเมฆ , born May 8, 1982) a.k.a Buakaw Banchamek (Thai: บัวขาว บัญชาเมฆ , Buakaw meaning "white lotus") is a Thai middleweight Muay Thai kickboxer of Kuy descent, who formerly fought out of Por.
