Despite appearing on three seasons of TLC’s polygamy-focused reality series <a href=#>Seeking Sister Wife</a>, the Colorado couple has yet to find <a href=#>a woman willing to join their family</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_48>In the season 5 finale, which aired on May 27, <a href=#>Dannielle and Garrick</a> learned that Nathalia, the Brazilian woman they’d been courting, wanted out of the relationship. But it didn’t take long for the couple to bounce back from the disappointment and find a new potential sister wife.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nathalia-clashes-with-the-merrifields-over-another-woman-in-the-seeking-sister-wife-season-5-finale>Nathalia clashes with the Merrifields over another woman in the ‘Seeking Sister Wife’ Season 5 finale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_60>After <a href=#>their relationship with Roberta fell apart</a> at the end of Seeking Sister Wife Season 4, Dannielle and Garrick moved on with Nathalia. Like Roberta, Nathalia was from Brazil, and Garrrick planned to marry her in that country and then bring her to the U.S. on a spousal visa. But it didn’t take long for that plan to go sideways.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_50>First, Dannielle learned that she was expecting a third child with Garrick. That surprise pregnancy threw Nathalia for a loop, as she was under the impression that Garrick and Dannielle didn’t plan on having more kids. Then, a judge in Brazil refused to allow Garrick and Nathalia to get married.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_65>After that disappointment, Garrick and Dannielle returned to the U.S. They continued to date Nathalia, but at the same time, Dannielle started chatting with Mariam, a Muslim woman from Michigan. Mariam visited the Merrifields in Colorado to see if she might be a good fit for the family. That didn’t sit well with Nathalia, who was not on board with Garrick taking a third wife.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_57>“Things are not good with Nathalia,” a tearful Dannielle confessed in the season 5 finale. “Mariam seems to be a really good fit for our family, and I think that Nathalia just didn’t expect that to happen. And now she is very upset, to put it mildly. And I just don’t think it’s going to work out.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nathalia-claims-garrick-wanted-total-submission>Nathalia claims Garrick wanted ‘total submission’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_19>Soon after Dannielle shared her fears about the relationship, Nathalia reached out to the producers of Seeking Sister Wife.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_23>“Many things” had changed since Dannielle and Garrick returned to the U.S. from their visit to Brazil, Nathalia said in a video message.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_15>Inviting Mariam to stay at their home in Colorado was a major betrayal, she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_48>“Since the beginning of my relationship with Garrick I showed my dissatisfaction with him adding a new person without me living with the rest of the family,” she said. “And he talked to me and said I could trust him and he would wait for me to arrive.”</p><p id=par-11_9>Garrick’s demeanor was also a concern, according to Nathalia.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_47>“In addition, Garrick began to demand total submission to him, a fact that I do not agree with,” she said. “And for these reasons there is no longer a relationship between the two of us. I have decided that I no longer want to continue this relationship.”</p><p id=par-13_12>The following day, Nathalia officially ended her relationship with Garrick and Dannielle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-garrick-was-heartbroken-over-losing-nathalia-but-he-quickly-moved-on>Garrick was ‘heartbroken’ over losing Nathalia, but he quickly moved on&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_14>Garrick was frustrated that a relationship with yet another potential sister wife had failed.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_12>“I’m hurt,” he said. “That’s my wife. I love her. I’m heartbroken.”</p><p id=par-16_18>At the same time, he took the breakup as a sign the relationship was not meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_30>‘I feel like Nathalia is still unwilling to address some of her issues in her heart and mind,” he added. “She’s not really being a team player in the family.”</p><p id=par-18_29>While Dannielle and Garrick remained hopeful that Mariam would be the right person to join their family, an epilogue revealed that she and the Merrifields were no longer dating.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-19_58>However, they haven’t given up on their <a href=#>dream of a plural marriage</a>. Garrick is now seeing a woman named Lorrana, it was revealed at the end of the Seeking Sister Wife finale. The first time the met, he baptized her and proposed. Now, he and Dannielle are trying to bring her to the U.S. on a K-1 visa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-20_9>Seeking Sister Wife Season 5 is streaming on Max.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-21_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAprHKoqWgZaOewLWx0Wauop6VYruiwMeao6KZXZnCrrzSZp6aqqKesKx50p6YrKeeYoJussinmKWdXp3BrriO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnathalia-dumped-garrick-in-season-5-finale-but-he-s-already-found-someone-new.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./riz-ahmed-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./riz-ahmed-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Riz Ahmed Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-the-family-law-star-married-kids-family.html>Is The Family Law Star Married?
