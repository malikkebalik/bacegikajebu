Carla DiBello first became famous as a producer of reality shows like "Keeping up with the Kardashians." She eventually founded her own production company, but more importantly she has forged a highly-successful career serving as a consultant/liaison between western businesses and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through her firm CDB Advisory. Through her production company and Arabia+ she has produced films and televisions shows in and about the Gulf region. She is also a columnist for publications like Harper's Bazaar Arabia and Arab News.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293836 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/carl.png alt width=638 height=524 sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293836 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Carla DiBello was born on March 28, 1984 in Sarasota, Florida. One of her family friends growing up was the daughter of a money manager for members of the Saudi royal family, including the <a href=#>King of Saudi Arabia</a>. The friend moved back to Saudi Arabia soon after the 9/11 attacks after it was revealed that two of the attackers spent time with the family while they were living in Florida taking flying lessons. This connection would become important later in Carla's life.</p><h2 id=producing-career><strong>Producing Career</strong></h2><p>Carla moved to Los Angeles in her early 20s. One of her first jobs was working for casino magnate <a href=# title="Steve Wynn Net Worth">Steve Wynn</a>. She eventually morphed into a producer after working as an assistant to producer <a href=#>Avi Lerner</a>.</p><p>She was an associate producer on such projects as "Black Dahlia", "The Wicker Man", "Home of the Brave", "The Contract", "King of California", "88 Minutes", "The Death and Life of Bobby Z", and "Street Kings".</p><p>Her most successful work as a producer involved the Kardashian family. Carla was one of Kim Kardashian's closest friends before the socialite became internationally famous. Carla appeared in several episodes of "Keeping up with the Kardashians" and served as a producer for the show "Kourtney and Kim Take New York," which starred <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and her sister <a href=#>Kourtney</a>. She also produced a season of a reality show called "The Spin Crowd."</p><p>Carla ceased working with the Kardashians in 2013 after forming her own production company, CDB.</p><h2 id=kobe-bryant-connection><strong>Kobe Bryant Connection</strong></h2><p>Carla DiBello became somewhat of a household name in 2011 due to her alleged involvement with basketball star <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a>. At the time Kobe had been involved in a very public divorce from his wife, <a href=# title="Vanessa Bryant Net Worth">Vanessa Bryant</a>. That divorce was eventually called-off, but Carla had been named as his <a href=#>second mistress</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293838 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/carla.jpg alt="Carka DiBello Net Worth" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293838 class=wp-caption-text>Photo by Darren Arthur/Getty Images</p><h2 id=dubai-saudi-arabia><strong>Dubai and Saudi Arabia</strong></h2><p>In 2005 Carla helped organize the Dubai Film festival. The success of this festival opened more doors and inspired her to spend more time in the Gulf region. During this period she reconnected with her childhood friend whose father manged money for the Saudi Royal family.</p><p>Carla soon carved out an interesting role as somewhat of a go-between for the western world and Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Her production company has produced films for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia including one about the country's Formula E electric car race. Carla also helped broker the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund's deal to acquire the Newcastle United soccer team for $445 million. She has helped dozens of American executives land meetings with the Investment Fund.</p><h2 id=arabia><strong>Arabia+</strong></h2><p>In January 2021 Carla founded Arabia+, which is a self-described "award-winning studio and premier streaming destination dedicated to providing global access to authentic Middle Easter stories via film and television.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8KaqaWZXZm2o7HLpaZmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarla-dibello-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dungeons-and-dragons-welcomes-some-monstrous-new-additions-created-by-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dungeons-and-dragons-welcomes-some-monstrous-new-additions-created-by-kids.html>Dungeons and Dragons welcomes some monstrous new additions created by kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bad-bunny-and-j-balvin.html>Bad Bunny and J Balvin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bad-bunny-and-j-balvin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
