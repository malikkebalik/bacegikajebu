He said of his short-lived boxing career, "I thought, 'You must be nuts to get your head beat in for $200.' The theater seemed a lot more appealing." Palance spent two years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on a football scholarship, but he left after becoming unhappy with how much the sport had become commercialized.</p><p>Jack served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, and according to a persistent rumor, he became disfigured when he was "badly burned in a test flight over Arizona when the B-24 bomber he piloted crashed and exploded" and had to undergo reconstructive surgery. Palance responded to the rumors, stating, "Studio press agents make up anything they want to, and reporters go along with it. One flack created the legend that I had been blown up in an air crash during the war, and my face had to be put back together by way of plastic surgery. If it is a 'bionic face', why didn't they do a better job of it?" Jack was honorably discharged in September 1945, then he enrolled at Stanford University.
