The previous year, Mukhtar stated that Azam "forced her to have an abortion and made false promises of marriage." According to "ESPN cricinfo," "Mukhtar filed a complaint with the FIA â€“ Pakistan's federal investigating body â€“ alleging that she had received threatening phone calls and messages from unidentified people. On investigation, the FIA found one of the numbers to be registered to Azam â€“ who they refer to as Muhammad Babar. Azam was summoned to appear before the agency but didn't. In his place his brother Faisal Azam appeared, asking for more time." In January 2021, Mukhtar withdrew the complaints she had made in 2020, stating, "I am recording this statement without any pressure.
