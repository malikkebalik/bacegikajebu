First having appeared in a recurring <a href=#>role as Officer Kevin Atwater</a> on&nbsp;Chicago Fire&nbsp;in 2013, he was cast as the same character on Fire’s spinoff series,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago P.D</a><a href=#>.</a>, in 2014.&nbsp;A native of the Chicago suburb of Harvey, <a href=#>Hawkins gets to work close to home</a> while earning a living. His role on the show continues to grow and develop in ways he may not have imagined at the onset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LaRoyce-Hawkins.jpg><h2 id=h-hawkins-always-wanted-to-act>Hawkins always wanted to act</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-2_62>While the 6-foot, 3-inch-tall actor was serious about basketball during his years in high school, he also joined the speech team. Starting in comedy, Hawkins won the Illinois High Speech Association state championships for comedy speech writing in his junior and senior years. Upon graduation, he attended Illinois State College on a full-tuition scholarship where he majored in acting, according to <a href=#>IMDb</a>.</p><p id=par-3_81>Before Hawkins took on his dramatic role in&nbsp;Chicago PD, he took to the stage as a stand-up comedian in comedy clubs. His first movie role came in 2008 portraying Art Baker in The Express: The Ernie Davis Story. In 2011, he nabbed a guest role in an episode of&nbsp;Detroit 1-8-7. The next year, he received another guest role, this time on&nbsp;Underemployed. Then, <a href=#>show creator Dick Wolf</a> caught wind of him, and Hawkins was cast in his recurring role on Chicago Fire.</p><h2 id=h-laroyce-hawkins-as-officer-atwater-on-chicago-pd>LaRoyce Hawkins as Officer Atwater on ‘Chicago PD’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_61>During those early days on&nbsp;Chicago Fire, Officer Atwater was a patrol cop. That is what Hawkins’ character portrayed early on in&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;as well. He was partnered with <a href=#>Officer Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati)</a>.&nbsp;By the end of the first season, Officer Atwater was bumped up to the Intelligence team, chosen by its commander Sergeant Hank Voight (Jason Beghe). Officer Burgess soon followed.</p><p id=par-5_96>Along with the rest of the team, Atwater often goes undercover to flush out a variety of unseemly characters. Hawkins is proud of what his character portrays. To date, <a href=#>he has been the only Black officer</a> in the unit. In recent times <a href=#>he has taken on a larger role</a> of portraying what it is like to be a Black police officer in today’s world. We’ve seen Atwater take on a higher profile during the show last season having to grapple with the color of his uniform and the color of his skin in the current landscape.</p><h2 id=h-hawkins-personal-life-and-net-worth>Hawkins’ personal life and net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_45>Now 32, Hawkins is not married. It is hard to say whether, or not he is seeing anyone. He keeps his personal life just that, personal. Since many photos have arisen of him with a young boy, he is believed to have a son.</p><p id=par-7_44>Considering his continued gig on&nbsp;Chicago PD&nbsp;and his importance to the show, it makes sense he has an impressive net worth. Estimates about his net worth reveal anywhere from $1 million in 2019, according to <a href=#>Gossip Gist</a> to $11 million, according to <a href=#>TV Show Stars</a>.</p><p id=par-8_42>What Hawkins doesn’t keep private is the charitable work he is involved in. He strongly believes in giving back to his community. He continues to bond with school children in Harvey and the rest of Chicago. He also supports many local charities.</p><p id=par-9_44>Hawkins earned an Emmy Award for his publicity campaign as Celebrity Kettle Ambassador for the Salvation Army, according to Chicago TV station <a href=#>WGNTV</a>. He is also working on cleaning up and brightening up Harvey, which too often has been seen “in a negative light.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqbXCmp6oZaBisW7Dx5qrZqGjYrmivs6ymp5lmJbErLXNrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FloaydoXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-laroyce-hawkins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carl-gallagher-s-age-in-real-life-might-surprise-you.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carl-gallagher-s-age-in-real-life-might-surprise-you.html>Carl Gallagher's Age in Real Life Might Surprise You</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html>The 'Hey Dude' Cast Looks Way Different Than They Did During Their Nickelodeon Days</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-hey-dude-cast-looks-way-different-than-they-did-during-their-nickelodeon-days.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
