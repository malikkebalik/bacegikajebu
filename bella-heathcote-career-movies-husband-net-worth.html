The name of her parents is not known to the general media. But sources suggest that her father was a lawyer. Hardly anything is available about the siblings too.</p><p>Bella holds the Australian nationality and also white ethnicity. Her zodiac sign falls under Pisces.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Bella was born in 1987, which makes her 32 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’6″ and weighs 56 kgs. Her fair complexion skin and also never-dying smile tends to make her a lot of fans globally. Her vital body statistics, however, stands at 32-24-24.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay McGraw Bio- Wife, Kids, Age, Height, Net Worth, Books, IG >></a></h4><p>Bella owns a slim body that suggests that a workout is a way to go for her. Added to all of her body measurements, greyish-blue eyes and light brown hair colour is something that makes her pretty off the blicks.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Bella was born in Melbourne and spent most of her childhood there with the family and sibling. There is nothing on the family name, but sources suggest that her mother died at 12. But there was the presence of freedom that led to choosing acting as a career.</p><p>For the educational background, though, Heathcote attended Korowa Anglican Girls School, and later, the interest in acting resulted in enrolling in Australian National Theatre Drama School.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Bella Heathcote is a growing name in the industry with excellent work all along the journey. Her job is undoubtedly something that will go on the rise.</p><p>The career began way back in 2008 when she was part of Acolytes. Along with it, she was part of the 2009 project Neighbours.

The limited audience was appreciating Isabella’s work, but the fame blew the roof when Fifty Shades Greater came to her, and there was no looking back.</p><p>Other commendable works include The Man’s likes&nbsp;in the High Castle, Professor Marston, and Wonder Woman. We feel that there is more great work coming along from the actress, and it will be our great pleasure to keep the fans updated.</p><h2>Bella Heathcote Husband</h2><p>Bella Heathcote is beautiful and dashing at the same time. Her charm and charisma can make anyone her fan, but someone as talented as she holds her hand.</p><p><strong>Andrew Dominik</strong> is an Australian film director who is talented and has given pretty decent products. Both of them started dating in 2010, and after the long-term vision, both of them are engaged in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bella-1487.jpg><p>At this point, they are more focused on their professional life and believe that walking down the aisle is something that can wait for them.</p><h2>Bella Heathcote Net Worth</h2><p>Bella Heathcote has been part of the industry since 2008. Its been some journey for her with regular works all along the line.
